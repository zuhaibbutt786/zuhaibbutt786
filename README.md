Hey! I'm Zuhaib Hussain Butt or as friends call me Zuhaib and welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋🏻


I'm a storyteller at heart and seasoned research & analytics professional who loves solving problems and telling stories with data. I have aided organizations adopt data-driven decision-making solutions to improve businesses. One of my major quests has been to leverage data to find actionable insights and thus connect dollars to the business outcomes. I call myself a Data Evangelist as I believe in empowering every individual with Data-Literacy, thus I have played the role of a mentor as well.

🙂 A little about my personality: I am the type of person who will ask “What can I do to help and improve?” when presented with a problem and will pitch in whenever needed to find out-of-the-box solutions to existing processes. I am energized by collaborating with other people to find solutions and implementing them to see improvement. I strongly believe in giving back to society and uplift everyone around me.

😎 Keeping data science aside, I love to sketch in my free time.
